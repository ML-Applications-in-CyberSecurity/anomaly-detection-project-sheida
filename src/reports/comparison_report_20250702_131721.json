        "llm_response": "**TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe provided network anomaly exhibits characteristics that warrant further investigation. The combination of a high source port (8080) and a non-standard destination port (62760) using UDP protocol raises suspicions. The packet size of 883 bytes is relatively large for a UDP packet, which may indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data or transmit malicious payloads.\n\nThe Isolation Forest detection algorithm has classified this anomaly as a PROTOCOL_PORT_MISMATCH, suggesting that the protocol (UDP) and destination port (62760) do not conform to expected traffic patterns. The ML Anomaly Score of -0.024649558802777416 indicates a high degree of anomaly, with more negative values indicating increased anomaly.\n\n**IOC IDENTIFICATION**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following IOCs are identified:\n\n* Source Port: 8080\n* Destination Port: 62760\n* Protocol: UDP\n* Packet Size: 883 bytes\n\n**ATTACK VECTOR**\n\nThe most likely attack methodology is a Command and Control (C2) communication or data exfiltration attempt. The use of a non-standard destination port and a large packet size may indicate an attempt to bypass security controls or transmit sensitive information. The source port 8080 is commonly associated with HTTP and proxy services, which could be used as a covert channel for C2 communication.\n\n**SEVERITY RATING**\n\nI rate the severity of this anomaly as **High**. The unusual protocol and port combination, along with the large packet size, suggest a potential malicious activity. The Isolation Forest algorithm's classification and the ML Anomaly Score further support this assessment.\n\n**MITIGATION STEPS**\n\nTo mitigate this potential threat, I recommend the following technical countermeasures:\n\n1. **Block traffic**: Immediately block incoming traffic from the source IP address and port 8080 to destination port 62760 using UDP protocol.\n2. **Inspect traffic**: Perform deep packet inspection on traffic from the source IP address to identify any malicious payloads or C2 communication patterns.\n3. **Monitor for similar activity**: Closely monitor network traffic for similar anomalies, focusing on non-standard port combinations and large packet sizes.\n4. **Update firewall rules**: Update firewall rules to restrict incoming traffic on non-standard ports and protocols.\n\n**FORENSIC NOTES**\n\nTo further investigate this anomaly, I recommend:\n\n1. **Packet capture analysis**: Perform a detailed analysis of the packet capture to identify any malicious payloads, encryption, or obfuscation techniques.\n2. **Source IP address analysis**: Investigate the source IP address to determine if it is associated with any known malicious actors or campaigns.\n3. **Network device logs**: Review network device logs to identify any other suspicious activity or connections related to the source IP address.\n4. **Endpoint analysis**: Analyze endpoint logs and system data to determine if any systems have been compromised or are communicating with the source IP address.\n\nBy following these recommendations, the SOC team can further investigate and contain this potential threat, while also improving overall network security posture.",
