        "llm_response": "**Technical Assessment:**\n\nThe anomaly in question exhibits unusual characteristics that warrant further investigation. The large packet size of 4727 bytes, combined with the short connection duration of 489 ms, suggests that the communication may be attempting to exfiltrate data or transfer a large amount of information in a short period.\n\nThe use of TCP port 443 as the source port is unusual, as this port is typically reserved for HTTPS traffic. It's possible that the attacker is attempting to masquerade as legitimate HTTPS traffic to evade detection. The destination port, 56058, is not a commonly used port, which may indicate a custom or proprietary protocol.\n\nThe Isolation Forest detection algorithm has assigned a highly negative anomaly score, indicating that this traffic pattern is significantly different from normal network behavior.\n\n**IOC Identification:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following IOCs can be identified:\n\n* Source port: 443\n* Destination port: 56058\n* Packet size: 4727 bytes\n* Unusual protocol behavior: TCP connection with a large packet size and short duration\n\n**Attack Vector:**\n\nGiven the characteristics of the anomaly, the most likely attack methodology is data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication. The attacker may be using a custom protocol or tool to transfer sensitive data or receive instructions from a remote server.\n\n**Severity Rating:**\n\nI would rate the severity of this anomaly as **High**. The unusual traffic pattern, combined with the large packet size and short connection duration, suggests that the attacker may be attempting to exfiltrate sensitive data or establish a covert communication channel.\n\n**Mitigation Steps:**\n\nTo mitigate this threat, I recommend the following technical countermeasures:\n\n1. Block traffic from source port 443 to destination port 56058 at the network perimeter.\n2. Implement packet capture and analysis to gather more information about the communication protocol and payload.\n3. Conduct a thorough investigation of the affected host(s) to determine the scope of the potential breach.\n4. Consider implementing a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect similar anomalies in real-time.\n\n**Forensic Notes:**\n\nTo further investigate this anomaly, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Capture and analyze the packet payload to determine the type of data being transferred.\n2. Investigate the affected host(s) for signs of malware or unauthorized access.\n3. Review system logs to identify any suspicious activity or authentication attempts.\n4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other hosts communicating with the suspicious destination port.\n\nBy following these recommendations, the SOC team can gather more information about the attack and take appropriate measures to prevent further compromise.",
