        "llm_response": "**Technical Assessment:**\n\nThe provided network anomaly characteristics and metrics suggest a suspicious TCP connection with a source port of 6666 and a destination port of 63900. The packet size of 336 bytes is relatively small, and the connection duration of 249 ms is brief. The Isolation Forest detection algorithm has assigned a negative ML Anomaly Score of -0.006429432827181114, indicating a high degree of anomaly.\n\nThe classification of SUSPICIOUS_SRC_PORT suggests that the source port 6666 is the primary reason for the anomaly detection. Port 6666 is not a commonly used port for legitimate traffic, and it is often associated with malware or unauthorized access.\n\n**IOC Identification:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following IOCs can be identified:\n\n* Source Port: 6666\n* Destination Port: 63900\n* Packet Size: 336 bytes\n* Connection Duration: 249 ms\n* Protocol: TCP\n\nThese IOCs can be used to create a signature-based detection rule to identify similar traffic patterns in the future.\n\n**Attack Vector:**\n\nThe most likely attack methodology is a Command and Control (C2) communication or a data exfiltration attempt. The use of an uncommon source port and a high destination port suggests that the attacker may be trying to evade detection. The brief connection duration and small packet size could indicate a reconnaissance or probing activity.\n\n**Severity Rating:**\n\nI would rate this anomaly as Medium severity. While the anomaly score is high, the packet size and connection duration are relatively small, which might indicate a reconnaissance or probing activity rather than a full-blown attack. However, the use of an uncommon source port and a high destination port warrants further investigation.\n\n**Mitigation Steps:**\n\nTo mitigate this anomaly, I recommend the following technical countermeasures:\n\n1. Block incoming traffic on source port 6666 at the network perimeter.\n2. Implement a signature-based detection rule to identify similar traffic patterns.\n3. Conduct a thorough network scan to identify any compromised hosts or devices.\n4. Enable logging and monitoring for destination port 63900 to detect any future connections.\n\n**Forensic Notes:**\n\nTo further investigate this anomaly, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Capture and analyze the packet capture (PCAP) data to identify any malicious payload or communication patterns.\n2. Conduct a memory dump analysis of any hosts or devices that communicated with the destination port 63900.\n3. Review system logs and network logs to identify any other suspicious activity.\n4. Perform a behavioral analysis of the suspected malware or unauthorized access to understand the attack vector and scope.\n\nBy following these recommendations, the SOC analysts can further investigate and contain the potential threat, and implement measures to prevent similar anomalies in the future.",
