        "llm_response": "**Technical Assessment:**\n\nThe provided network anomaly characteristics indicate a suspicious UDP packet with a source port of 80, typically associated with HTTP traffic, and a destination port of 64528, which is a high-range ephemeral port. The packet size of 102 bytes is unusually small for HTTP traffic, which often ranges from 500 to 1500 bytes. The connection duration of 113 ms suggests a brief, potentially probing, interaction.\n\nThe Isolation Forest detection algorithm has classified this packet as UNUSUAL_PACKET_SIZE, indicating that the packet size deviates significantly from the expected norm. The ML Anomaly Score of -0.0039243717422013935 further supports the notion that this packet is anomalous.\n\n**IOC Identification:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following IOCs can be identified:\n\n* Source Port: 80 (unusual for UDP traffic)\n* Destination Port: 64528 (high-range ephemeral port)\n* Packet Size: 102 bytes (unusually small for HTTP traffic)\n* Protocol: UDP (unexpected protocol for HTTP traffic)\n\n**Attack Vector:**\n\nGiven the characteristics of this packet, it is likely that this is a reconnaissance or probing attempt, potentially part of a larger reconnaissance campaign. The use of UDP and a high-range ephemeral port may indicate an attempt to bypass traditional security controls or evade detection. The small packet size could be an attempt to test the responsiveness of the target system or identify potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**Severity Rating:**\n\nI would rate this anomaly as Medium severity. While the packet itself may not be malicious, it exhibits suspicious characteristics that warrant further investigation. The potential for this to be a reconnaissance attempt or a precursor to a more significant attack cannot be ruled out.\n\n**Mitigation Steps:**\n\n1. Implement UDP traffic filtering or rate limiting to prevent similar packets from reaching the target system.\n2. Configure security controls to alert on or block traffic with unusual packet sizes, especially when originating from unexpected ports.\n3. Enhance logging and monitoring to capture more detailed information about similar packets, including source IP addresses and packet contents.\n4. Consider implementing a Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) solution to gain better visibility into network communications.\n\n**Forensic Notes:**\n\nTo further investigate this anomaly, I recommend:\n\n1. Capturing and analyzing the packet contents to identify any potential malicious payloads or encoding.\n2. Reviewing system logs for any corresponding access or error logs that may indicate the target system's response to this packet.\n3. Investigating the source IP address to determine if it is associated with known malicious actors or has a history of suspicious activity.\n4. Conducting a network-wide scan to identify any other systems that may have received similar packets, indicating a broader reconnaissance campaign.\n\nBy following these recommendations, SOC analysts can gain a deeper understanding of this anomaly and take proactive measures to prevent potential attacks.",
