        "llm_response": "**Technical Assessment**\n\nThe observed network anomaly exhibits characteristics that warrant further investigation. The use of UDP protocol with a source port of 22 (typically associated with SSH) and a destination port of 3994 (an uncommon port) raises suspicions. The large packet size of 1473 bytes is also unusual, as UDP packets are typically smaller.\n\nThe Isolation Forest detection algorithm has assigned a high anomaly score (-0.02340592860825097), indicating that this traffic pattern is significantly different from normal traffic. The classification of LARGE_PACKET suggests that the packet size is a key factor in this anomaly.\n\n**IOC Identification**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following IOCs are identified:\n\n* Source Port: 22\n* Destination Port: 3994\n* Packet Size: 1473 bytes\n* Protocol: UDP\n\nThese IOCs can be used to create custom signatures for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect similar traffic patterns.\n\n**Attack Vector**\n\nThe most likely attack methodology is a potential Command and Control (C2) communication or data exfiltration attempt. The use of an uncommon destination port (3994) and a large packet size may indicate an attempt to establish a covert channel for malicious communication. The source port of 22 could be an attempt to masquerade as legitimate SSH traffic.\n\n**Severity Rating**\n\nI rate this anomaly as **High** severity due to the following factors:\n\n* Uncommon port usage and packet size\n* High anomaly score indicating a significant deviation from normal traffic\n* Potential for C2 communication or data exfiltration\n\n**Mitigation Steps**\n\nTo mitigate this potential threat, I recommend the following technical countermeasures:\n\n1. Block UDP traffic from source port 22 to destination port 3994 at the network perimeter.\n2. Implement packet size filtering to restrict large UDP packets (e.g., > 1024 bytes).\n3. Monitor SSH traffic for suspicious activity, such as unusual packet sizes or unexpected destinations.\n4. Conduct a thorough review of network logs to identify any other related anomalies.\n\n**Forensic Notes**\n\nTo further investigate this anomaly, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Capture and analyze the packet contents to identify any potential malicious payloads.\n2. Review system logs for any suspicious activity related to the destination IP address and port 3994.\n3. Perform a network scan to identify any other devices communicating with the destination IP address on port 3994.\n4. Conduct a memory dump analysis of any affected systems to identify potential malware or malicious code.\n\nBy following these recommendations, SOC analysts can further investigate this anomaly, contain potential threats, and improve overall network security.",
