SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
 1. HIGH PRIORITY: Review 8 high-risk incidents within 24 hours
 2. Monitor/block suspicious ports: 9999, 6666
 3. Review 16 large packet transfers (potential data exfiltration)
 4. High UDP anomaly rate detected - review DNS and other UDP services
 5. Implement real-time alerting for anomaly scores < -0.05
 6. Set up automated incident response workflows
 7. Conduct weekly security team reviews of anomaly patterns
 8. Update network monitoring rules based on detected patterns
 9. Consider network segmentation for high-risk traffic flows

RISK ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------
Overall Risk Level: HIGH
Trend Analysis: Increasing
Business Impact: Network security incidents requiring investigation

NEXT STEPS
----------------------------------------
1. Prioritize investigation of high-severity incidents
2. Implement recommended security controls
3. Schedule follow-up analysis in 7 days
4. Brief security leadership on findings
